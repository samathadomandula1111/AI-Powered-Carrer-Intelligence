# CareerInfinity

CareerInfinity is a small Flask application with static HTML pages and Firebase
Authentication. Its resume analyzer extracts text from PDF and DOCX uploads and
returns keyword-based career suggestions.

## Run locally (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
cd CareerInfinity
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. The dashboard is at
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard`. The server binds to loopback and runs with
debug mode disabled by default.

The static pages use the Firebase web-app configuration in `index.html` and
`dashboard.html`. Firebase web API keys identify a web app; they are not server
credentials. Restrict the key to the intended APIs and authorized domains in
the Firebase/Google Cloud console. The backend verifies Firebase ID tokens
against `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` and does not require service-account credentials.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` as a reference, then set the variables in your
shell or hosting environment. `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` must match the `projectId`
in both HTML pages. Flask does not automatically load `.env`.
`CORS_ORIGINS` is a comma-separated allowlist for a separately hosted frontend;
the default allows the two local Flask origins. Keep any added origins specific
to the frontend hosts you control.

## Data and API

- `GET /api/health` reports whether Flask is responding.
- `GET /api/profile` returns the signed-in user's profile, roadmap progress,
  saved placement drives, and latest resume analysis.
- `PATCH /api/profile` updates profile fields, roadmap progress, saved drives,
  and interview practice answers.
  Both profile endpoints require a valid Firebase ID token.
- `POST /api/analyze-resume` accepts a signed-in user's `resume` PDF or DOCX,
  up to 5 MB, and returns resume, profile, and skill estimates plus ranked
  career matches with detected skills and skills to improve for each role.
  The result and uploaded filename are saved to the signed-in user's profile.
- Resume file contents are processed in memory and are not stored by the backend.
-   profile, latest analysis, saved drives, roadmap progress, and interview practice
  answers are stored in SQLite at `instance/career-infinity.sqlite3` by default. Set
  `CAREERINFINITY_DB_PATH` to an absolute path on persistent storage in hosted
  environments. Back up this database and restrict access to its directory.
- Theme and sidebar display preferences remain in browser local storage; career
  profile and progress data do not.

The resume score and skill matches are heuristics, not formal assessments.
The resume score is capped below 100 and breaks down detected skills, projects,
impact/metrics, resume structure, and role keywords. Skill levels describe
keyword frequency in the resume; they do not prove proficiency.
Scanned/image-only PDFs need OCR, which is not included.
The Roadmap includes Automation Engineer and Agentic AI Engineer paths. The
dashboard visualizes detected target-role skills and account-saved topic and
project progress; matches remain keyword-based estimates.

The Jobs & Drives page provides role matches from resume analysis and lets users
save opportunities they find. This app does not have a live vacancy-feed
provider or an external jobs endpoint, so it does not claim that suggested
roles are current openings. Interview Prep creates guided practice prompts from
the selected target role and skills detected in the latest resume analysis.
Prompts use deterministic templates, not an AI model, and answers are saved to
the signed-in user's profile; the app does not score or evaluate responses.

## Tests

python -m unittest discover -s . -p "*test.py" -v
